## Context

<https://www.vox.com/2016/8/31/12715176/most-popular-dog-breeds>

280 breeds

these dogs are registered through the [American Kennel Club](http://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/) (AKC), which categorizes and tallies up the totals of more than 150 breeds.

> In 1991, the Labrador retriever became the most popular dog --- and for the past 25 years it has retained its throne
>
> psychology professor Hal Herzog laid out what he called the "cultural
> drift" effect: Instead of studying up on various breeds, **dog owners tend
> to mimic the choices of others** --- neighbors, friends, celebrities.
>
> "**breeds enjoy heydays of approximately 25 years** ... [which] usually allows
> for two to three generations of dogs, as the breed transforms from
> novel to passÃ©."
